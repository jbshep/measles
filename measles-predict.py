# STUDENTS: you will peruse the files named lin.py and
# multi-lin.py to see examples of how to construct a linear regression
# model.  Then, you will try to create your own linear regression in this file
# that uses the data we have merged together (data/mmr-vax.csv)
# to predict the likelihood of a measles outbreak in U.S. states.
